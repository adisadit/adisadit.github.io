## A brief history about my career

I'm GIS enthusiast who have big interest in travel, programming, photography and video games. I studied at University of Indonesia with Geography as my major. In my university life, I joined Geography Mountaineering Club (GMC) to expand my experience in mountaineering activities. It was a great experience to joined GMC because I can went to several beautiful mountains with my friends such as Gede-Pangrango and Argopuro.

After graduated in 2012, I start to work in Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team as GIS Trainer. From there I learn a lot about open-source GIS, such as OpenStreetMap and QGIS. I also learn how to talk in front of people and teach them about mapping. It really difficult to teach people about technical stuff without giving a simple example in the real life and yet I manage it so far. Right now I'm able to give simple explanation and example about technical terms such as Coordinate Reference System (CRS), vector geoprocessing analysis (Clip, buffer, intersect,etc), and relation tag in OpenStreetMap. In 2014-2016, 

I got promoted as Senior GIS Trainer. With new title I also have new responsibilites. I must manage curriculum related to OSM, QGIS and InaSAFE (a QGIS's plugin to analyze impact of disaster) and create a standar operation procedure to test InaSAFE everytime the developer give a new release. This time I also have opportunity to met Phillipines OSM Mappers: Maning, Erwin and Eugene. In this opportunity we held module sprint event to enhance learnosm.org training materials. Not only that, I also have opportunities to presented our country projects in the first HOT Summit event @Washington DC,2015.

From 2016 until now I'm still working in HOT with new title, a GIS Project Coordinator. I manage a team of four amazing people to do our several projects from creating risk assessment documents (for Toraja, Jepara, Kudus and Soe districts), training OSM,QGIS+InaSAFE for communities, collaborate with DMInnovation's people to develop guideliness for using InaSAFE for disaster management until held the first University Battle Mapping Competition in Indonesia (for celebrating Geo Awareness Week in 2017).
